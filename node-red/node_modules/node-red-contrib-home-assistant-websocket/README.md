Various nodes to assist in setting up automation using [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) communicating with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/).

## Project status

Project is going through active development and as such will probably have a few 'growing pain' bugs as well as node type, input, output and functionality changes. At this stage backwards compatibility between versions is not a main concern and a new version **may mean you'll have to recreate certain nodes.**

## Getting Started

This assumes you have [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) already installed and working, if you need to install Node-RED see [here](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation).

**NOTE:** This requires at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v8.12.x and [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) v0.19.x.

Install via Node-RED Manage Palette

```
node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket
```

Install via npm

```shell
$ cd ~/.node-red
$ npm install node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket
# then restart node-red
```

For [Hass.io](https://hass.io/) add-on users:

The Community Hass.io add-on ships with this node right out of the box.

Under the server node config just check the checkbox for `I use Hass.io`

The add-on can be found here: <https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-node-red#readme>

## Migrating

Coming from a different version, e.g. [@Ayapejian](https://github.com/AYapejian/node-red-contrib-home-assistant) or [@Spartan-II-117](https://github.com/Spartan-II-117/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-llat)?

If you have been using [@Ayapejian](https://github.com/AYapejian/node-red-contrib-home-assistant) version there are some breaking changes with two of the nodes. The ‘Poll State’ and ‘Current State’ both have a little different formatted outputs. Check your nodes and make sure they are outputting what you expect. A more in depth example can be found [here](https://github.com/zachowj/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/wiki/Migration).

If you have been using the [@Spartan-II-117](https://github.com/Spartan-II-117/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-llat) fork this should be a drop in replacement.

## Nodes

The installed nodes have more detailed information in the Node-RED info pane shown when the node is selected. Below is a quick summary

#### All Events

Listens for all types of events from home assistant with the ability to filter by event type

#### State Changed Event

Listens for only `state_changed` events from home assistant

#### State Trigger

Much like the `State Changed Node` however provides some advanced functionality around common automation use cases.

#### Poll State

Outputs the state of an entity at regular intervals, optionally also at startup
and every time the entity changes if desired

#### Webhook

_Need [Custom Integration](https://github.com/zachowj/hass-node-red) installed in Home Assistant for node to function_

Outputs the data received from the created webhook in Home Assistant

#### Call Service

Sends a request to home assistant for any domain and service available ( `light/turn_on`, `input_select/select_option`, etc..)

#### Fire Event

Fire an event on the event bus

#### Sensor

_Need [Custom Integration](https://github.com/zachowj/hass-node-red) installed in Home Assistant for node to function_

Creates a sensor or binary sensor in Home Assistant which can be updated
from this node

#### Current State

Fetches the last known state for any entity on input

#### Get Entities

Get entities based on search criteria with 3 different output options

#### Get History

Fetches HomeAssistant history on input

#### Get Template

Allows rendering of templates on input

#### Wait Until

When an input is received the node will wait until the condition is met or the timeout occurs then will pass on the last received message
