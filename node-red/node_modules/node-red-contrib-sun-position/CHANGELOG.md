# node-red-contrib-sun-position

#### 1.0.0: mayor release

- new Node: clock-time
  - This is a simplified blind-control node, with only time rules and any payload.
  - it is ideal for dimmers, Christmas lights, ...
- time-inject
  - added month selection
  - added even/odd day selection
- within-time
  - added day selection
  - added month selection
  - added even/odd day selection
- blind control
  - added possibility to limit rules for several days
  - added validation of rules (shows a hint if a rule in invalid)
  - added day selection to rules
  - added month selection to rules
  - added even/odd day selection for rules
  - added auto Trigger capability
- general
  - added on several settings the possibility to use payload if the topic of an incoming message contains special value.
  - fixed smaller problems

- The big jump in the version number is not only due to the amount change, but rather otherwise.
  - The Version starting with 1... will show that this node is tested and working with Node-Red above 1...
  - After this release, no major changes are planned in the next time and the node is for the time being feature complete. This fits a version number 1.. better than 0..

#### 0.5.3 + 0.5.4: BugFix

- general
  - fix for #68

#### 0.5.2: BugFix

- general
  - fix for error on getting tooltip #69

#### 0.5.1: BugFix and Maintenance Release

- general
  - fix for week number calculation when in daylight saving #65
  - if time output as object the week is now an extra object with properties
    - iso *array* `[year, week]`
    - week *number* week number
    - year *number* full year
    - even *boolean* is true if week is even
- blind control
  - fix for #66 if the blind not uses values between 0 and 1
  - fix for #67 mixed earliest and latest settings
  - enhanced output of the rules
  - change logic of rule execution: From rules within Until rules will now considered.
    - change should have no affect if rule setup is equal to the examples, that time restricted rules separated in first only until and afterwards only from rules

#### 0.5.0: mayor release for blind control

- configuration
  - switched latitude and longitude and added openstreetmap link/map for the position to prevent issues caused by latitude and longitude (maybe cause of #55)
  - added german translation for latitude and longitude

- time inject
  - added output of week number to enhanced date output
  - enhanced name output for enhanced date output

- sun-position
  - fixed #52 bug with implementation
    - added `positionAtSolarNoon` as additional payload property with the position data of the sun at solar noon
  - fixed problem with `msg.ts` not considered as used timestamp

- moon-position
  - fixed problem with `msg.ts` not considered as used timestamp

- blind control
  - fixed #61 by removing misleading angle
  - fixed #62 `setMode` can now deactivate sun control
  - added `resetOverwrite` additional property #54
  - add possibility to have a exact priority comparisons (e.g. only reset a specific priority)
  - redesigned rule input by dialog
  - removed previous reset option for level operator, will now be done by new special level type
  - added new type of Level: `NotDefined`, where for absolute rules default or sunControl will be used and for min/max the rule will be reset.
    - This will allow to have only one type of time rules (until/from) which could cover whole day.
    - Hopefully this makes rules easier.
  - added per rule two different times and two different conditions
    - allows to define more scenarios
    - allows to reduce amount of needed rules.
